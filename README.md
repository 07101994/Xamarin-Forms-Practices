# Xamarin-Forms-Practices
Collection of good practices for Xamarin forms developement in a dangerous async world.

Well it's a little bit **Task oriented**, I'm a bit obsessed with view model initialization and Task state management :)

## Why ?

On the Xamarin slack, a question keeps popping:

what is the "good" way of initializing a view model ?

Spoiler alert, this is wrong:

```csharp

public async void Initialize(object parameter)
{
    await InitializationCodeAsync((int)parameter);
}

```

This is a little better:

```csharp

public async void Initialize(object parameter)
{
    try
    {
        await InitializationCodeAsync((int)parameter);
    }
    catch (Exception exception)
    {
        ExceptionHandler.Handle(exception);
    }
}

```

But wait, I want to give a UI feedback to the user:

```csharp

public async void Initialize(object parameter)
{
    IsBusy = true;
    HasErrors = false;
    try
    {
        await InitializationCodeAsync((int)parameter);
    }
    catch (Exception exception)
    {
        ExceptionHandler.Handle(exception);
        HasErrors = true;
        ErrorMessage = 
    }
    finally
    {
        IsBusy = false;
    }
}

```

Pfew, this a lot of copy paste on each of my VM, I will create a base VM for this, and all my VM will inherit from that.

```
STOP NOW, just stop for the love of will ferrell.
```

**Inheritance** is nice, but don't solve all your code reuse issues with it.

**Composition** is *almost* always better.

## NotifyTask

Now for the loading part, the issue has been tackled years ago by [Stephen Cleary](https://i.pinimg.com/236x/40/50/80/40508052830e8d54585ee7a83008e00c--monty-python-morals.jpg).
You should use a NotifyTask object to wrap your async initialization.
It garantees that the exception is correctly caught, and it will notify you (it implements ```INotifyPropertyChanged```).

Start by reading this: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dn605875.aspx.
Then go to its github: https://github.com/StephenCleary/Mvvm.Async/tree/master/src/Nito.Mvvm.Async.

The ```NotifyTask``` object has evolved.
It's just a wrapper around a Task, with all the tools you need to give an UI feedback to your users.

I simply added some callbacks to ease the composition, a builder pattern, and some logging to give developper feedback in output window.

## ViewModelLoader

source: https://github.com/roubachof/Xamarin-Forms-Practices/blob/master/SillyCompany.Mobile.Practices/ViewModels/ViewModelLoader.cs

An object wrapping a ```NotifyTask``` (which wraps a ```Task```, you follow ?), filling the gap between pure 
Task UI management and Views data loading scenarios.

It was created for separation of concerns, NotifyTask must remain async focused while ViewModelLoader should answer to all 
the needs of the views.

It will handle classic loading patterns:

```
start loading 
show loading indicator
end loading 
dismiss indicator
if error: show error view with retry button and corresponding error message
if success: show result
```

It will also handle a Pull-To-Refresh scenario:

1. You initialize your view model, data shows on the view
2. You pull to refresh
3. An error occurs: you don't want to show the error view since you have already data, you just want to display a visual feedback

### TaskLoaderView

source: https://github.com/roubachof/Xamarin-Forms-Practices/tree/master/SillyCompany.Mobile.Practices/Views

This is a container for any view, that will handle the above scenarios.
It is bound to the ViewModelLoader and will handle the visibility of all the views:

1. Loading spinner view
2. Result view
3. Error view
4. Refresh error view (snackbar-like)
